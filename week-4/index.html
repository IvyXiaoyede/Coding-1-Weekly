/*This program mainly makes use of the Mandelbrot set - a very famous image
-This equation is applied by this Mandelbrot set, but it doesn't do anything in our program, it's just an equation that we need to understand, we don't need to understand the whole process and where the equation comes from, the ensemble is a loop that uses the position of each pixel to perform the operation over and over again.
But for each pixel we need to have a test function to check if the position is appropriate, and each pixel has a maximum number of tests. If the output exceeds a certain value (2) then the pixel is outside the set. If not, it is inside the set.
There are many ways to calculate this, here we use the equation z^2=(zx^2-zy^2,2*zx*zy) to perform the test

var cx,cy=0;//We use c to represent the position of the complex number, defining cx and cy, using the var statement
var maxIterations=50;//We calculate the fractal by iterating the test for each pixel. The size of this number is the maximum number of tests, and we specify in the statement that the maximum fractal value is 50

      cy=j/(width/4);//Similarly, the value of cy needs to be fixed between -2 and 2. These two lines give us the complex number c, which is just (cx,cy).

If it is, we do nothing, and if it is not in the conditional range, we do not run the statement
